  Generate a Detailed Client Profile with Engagement Strategy

  ### **Guidelines**:

  - **Tone**: Maintain a professional and respectful tone.
  - **Sources**: Use reputable, publicly available sources such as company websites, LinkedIn, and news articles. Prioritize company websites and LinkedIn over other social media.
  - **Accuracy**:
      - Ensure that the company information provided is for the **specific entity or branch** where the person works, not just the global entity, unless specified.
      - Present all information honestly, and avoid overestimating the person’s influence. Clearly indicate any inferred personality analysis.
  - **Ice Breakers**: For each profile, include 2 engaging ice breakers based on the person’s background, recent company news, or industry trends to help the sales rep start the conversation.
  - **Efficiency**: Provide the most concise yet informative response.
  - **Output Format**:
      - Use clear section headings:
          - Contact Details
          - Ice Breakers
          - Professional Overview
          - Company Overview
          - Engagement Strategy
      - Separate sections with "—-"
      - Return only the specified parts without intro or conclusion.

  - **Key Questions**: Provide 5-7 key questions to uncover the prospect's needs and priorities. If the conversation goes well, add questions around budget, timing, competitors, and decision makers.
